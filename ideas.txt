You are a lonely astronaut trying to escape a blackhole.
The gameplay involves landing on tiny planets to gather resources like food, water, and fuel for survival.
Game end condition could be when player reaches a certain distance or self-sufficiency.

Might be necessary to include a Noah's Ark type aspect with plants and animals to make food system work.

The planets could vary in gravity and density, forcing the player to adjust to various conditions. 
Upgrades may include fuel quality, space suit properties, resource processing technologies.
These upgrades should be accessable through mineral resources like silicon, iron, carbon, etc.
Chemical processes should be greatly simplified for player experience.

Possibile Lines of Progression-
  Oxygen: Thermite Reaction (Aluminum + Iron Oxide) > Electrolysis (Energy, Chlorine + Iron Oxide)
  Pressure: Iron > Steel (Iron + Carbon) > Reinforced Steel Alloy (Steel, Nickel, Titanium, Molybdenum)
  Temperature: Glass/Silicon > Plastic (Refined Oil, Sulfur) > Hafnium Carbide (Hafnium, Carbon)
  Energy: Combustion (Solid Carbon + Oxygen) > Solar Energy (Silicon, Aluminum, Glass, Plastic) > Nuclear Fission (Uranium, Water)
  Fuels: Solid Fuel (Sulfur, Carbon, Zinc) > Liquid Fuel (Liquid Oxygen, Liquid Hydrogen) > Ion (Xenon, Neodymium) > Nuclear (Uranium, Water)

Suggested Resource Progression
  Carbon, Sulfur >
  Aluminum, Zinc + Copper >
  Iron Oxide, Oil + Hydrogen >
  Iron, Nickel, Oxygen + Chlorine >
  Silicon, Hafnium, Titanium >
  Liquid Elements, Xenon >
  Molybdenum, Neodymium >
  Uranium

Technical Ideas:
Planets are split into 4 sides. An active side is determined with a variable. When the player passes a point, the gravity and side switches.
Sides are stored as tilemaps.

UI Implementaion:
Pressing Q once will bring up the inventory. Repeated presses allow the player to cycle through their items. TAB closes the inventory menu.
